Difference between document and window object

A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object. 

What is document?
        The document object represents your web page. If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page
The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behaviour. 

The window object represents the browser window.
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window
